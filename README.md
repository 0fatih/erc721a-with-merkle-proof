This is an implementation of ERC721A with [MerkleProof](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/cryptography/MerkleProof.sol). Which is a method for verifying whitelisted addresses.

This implementation contains both presale and public sale. If you want to use it, you have to edit the code. For example; merkle root hash, prices, max nfts etc. And you can delete any set function you want.
